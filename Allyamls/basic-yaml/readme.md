There are three parts of a YAML configuration file

YAML is a friendly data serialization file standard for all programming languages.

YAML = YAML Ain't Markup Language

strict syntax indentation, so have checked before deploying using vscode or online.

1. metdata 
  metdata of a configuration file consists of name and label

3. status 
  it is automatically generated by kubernetes which has status of the yaml file. therefore the status of 
  kubernets checks the configuration file and understands what is desired state and actual state

<h3>Template</h3>

it has it's own "spec" and "metadata". 

blueprint of a pod.

contains port number and image names, container name in a pod

it is basically a config file .. inside of a config file. and this configuration applies to a pod.

<h3>Labels and selectors</h3>

connecting services to deployments. because services must know which pods are registered. which pod belong to the service and that
connection is made with the selector.
